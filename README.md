## UX

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to view other user's haikus so that I can see what other user's have written

- As a user, I want to be able to post my haiku so that I can share it with other users on the website

- As a user, I want to be able to easily copy or use social share buttons so that I can share my haikus on any platform outside of the website

- As a user, I want to be able to save my haikus so that I can read them at any later date

- As a user, I want to be able to save other user's haikus so that I can read them at a later date

- As a user, I want to be able to edit my haiku after I've posted it so that I can fix any typos or make any amendments if I need to

- As a user, I want to be able to report a haiku in the event that the content is offensive
