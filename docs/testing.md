# Testing

To ensure that the development environment is consistent across different machines, the .vscode directory was commited to the repository to ensure that:

1. [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the provided python formatter
2. [Pylint](https://pylint.org/) is the default linter

This assumes that you are using Visual Studio Code as your code editor.
